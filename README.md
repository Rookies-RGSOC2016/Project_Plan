<h1>Hi, Welcome to our Rookies' Oranization.</h1>
<p> We are HyeSoo and Tehetena:D <br/>
    We made this organization for sharing our ideas, building up Hoodie desktop app 
    and improving the last year project. Any feedbacks or ideas are always welcome(+Plus Happy coding) </p>

<h4>This is about what is Hoodie, our mentors and coaches, the goal of our project and our project plans.</h4>

<h1>1.Introduction of Hoodie</h1>
<ul>
<li>Hoodie is a framework for frontend web applications that abstracts away the backend. 
Simply, Hoodie is a no-Backend technology!:D </li>

<li>Hoodie gives your frontend code superpowers or Dreamcode, 
by allowing users to do things that only a backend can do.</li>

<li>Hoodie's vision and future goal are to be accessible for designers and 
people with few coding skills because Hoodie think this matters.
Hoodie is written entirely in JavaScript.</li>
</ul>

<h1>2. Mentors</h1>  
   <p><strong>*Hoodie Mentors</strong> : Jan Lehnardt<a href="https://twitter.com/janl" target="_blank">(@janl)</a>, Gregor<a href="https://twitter.com/gr2m" target="_blank">(@gr2m)</a><br>
   We are going to communicate with our mentors by email or Hoodie community Slack.<br>
   We had the first Hoodie group chat on Goolge hangout. We had a helpful meeting with Hoodie mentors and other parcitipants.</p>

<h1>3. Coaches</h1> 
   <p><strong>*Coahes</strong> : Esko Luontola<a href="https://twitter.com/orfjackal" target="_blank">(@orfjackal)</a>, Omid<a href="https://github.com/omidfi" target="_blank">(@omidfi)</a>, Musse bekabil<a href="https://github.com/mussebekabil" target="_blank"> (@mussebekabil)</a><br>
    We are going to have a meeting in person, emails or Facebook chat with coaches according to the conditions or coaches' schedules. <br>
    We have planned to have a regular Q&A session on topics which are new/complicated for us to understand or when we have challenges in our project,and also have a face to face regular meeting in the evening or on weekends or when coaches can make a time for us. <br>
    All three coaches live in the Helsinki where is same area with our place, so we can meet them in person and ask advice easily. <br>
    In the coming Helsinki Rails Girls meetup, we will present our chosen RGSOC project to Helsinki RG coaches.<br> 
	We joined the Helsinki RG meetup several time before, and they gave us chance to present it. <br>
    We wish we can find more coaches who are interested in our project or would like to help us to get involved in RGSOC.<br></p>
 
<h1>4. The goal of our project</h1>
<ul>
<li>Creating a downloadable Hoodie desktop application that manages Hoodie instead of writing command lines </li>
<li>Contributing our project to Open sources in GitHub </li>
<li>Learning new technologies and project management skills</li>
<li>Finalizing Hoodie desktop application with all the requirements and functionalities</li>
<li>Spreading happy energy to everyone who is part of this experience</li>
</ul>
