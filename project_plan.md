<h1>Hi, Welcome to our Rookies' Oranization.</h1>
<p> We are HyeSoo and Tehetena:D <br/>
    We made this organization for sharing our ideas, building up Hoodie desktop app 
    and improving the last year project. Any feedbacks or ideas are always welcome(+Plus Happy coding) </p>

<h4>This is about what is Hoodie, our mentors and coaches, the goal of our project and our project plans.</h4>

<h1>1.Introduction of Hoodie</h1>
<ul>
<li>Hoodie is a framework for frontend web applications that abstracts away the backend. 
Simply, Hoodie is a no-Backend technology!:D </li>

<li>Hoodie gives your frontend code superpowers or Dreamcode, 
by allowing users to do things that ony a backend can do.</li>

<li>Hoodie's vision and future goal are to be accessible for designers and 
people with few coding skills because Hoodie think this matters.
Hoodie is written entirely in JavaScript.</li>
</ul>

<h1>2. Mentors</h1>  
   <p><strong>*Hoodie Mentors</strong> : Jan Lehnardt<a href="https://twitter.com/janl" target="_blank">(@janl)</a>, Gregor<a href="https://twitter.com/gr2m" target="_blank">(@gr2m)</a><br>
   We are going to communicate with our mentors by email or Hoodie community Slack.<br>
   We had the first Hoodie group chat on Goolge hangout. We had a helpful meeting with Hoodie mentors and other parcitipants.</p>

    We are going to meet our coaches in person, emails or facebook chat according to the conditions or coaches' schedules.<br>
	We have plannned to have a regular Q&A session on topics which are new or complicated for us to understand.<br> 
	and also have a face to face regular meeting on weekends or when coaches can make a time for us</p>
 
<h1>4. The goal of our project</h1>
<ul>
<li>Creating a downloadable Hoodie desktop application that manages Hoodie instead of writing command lines </li>
<li>Contributing our project to Open sources in GitHub </li>
